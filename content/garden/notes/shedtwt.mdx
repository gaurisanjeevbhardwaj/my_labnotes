# Terminology and techniques adopted by X (Twitter) users to evade NSFW filters 

### There is a wide erray of filter/ban evasion techniques on Twitter, and the two communities I will be exploring are the eating disorder and the self harm community, popularly known as edtwt and shtwt respectively. Members of both communities indentify themselves as a part of the shedtwt subsection. 
- There are users that actively partake in more NSFW communities of similar nature, such as goretwt and NSFWtwt, along with being regular users of shedtwt community. 
- edtwt is further divided into a variety of aesthetics relating to body goals as well as having different eating disorders as cliques depending on what one identifies themselves with. 
- - one of the more broad divisions of the two is edtwt and recoverytwt, with the latter defining someone who is into recovery for eating disorders.
